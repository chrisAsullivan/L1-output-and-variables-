## python
python is an object orientated language

## output 
output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

the output we use `print()`

## comments 
comments are notes that the complier skips over

to use comments we use # comment COMMENT` for single line

we use ````comment```` for block comments

## data types
we will be working with 5 main data types

1. integer (int) - whole numbers
2. characters (char) - single letter, symbol, or number
3. string (str) - collection of characters
4. floating point (float) - decimal numbers
5. boolean (bool) - true/false
## variables
varaibles are containers that hold a value

### rules for variable names
1. always start with a letter
   1name = celtine -> not allowed
2. can only contain numbers letters and underscores
3. if more than one word use camelcase or underscores to seperate words
myfirstname or my_first_name


## concatenation
+ adding strings together, appending (add to end)
+ "hello " + "world" = "hello world"

## type cast
forcing a data type on a value

### to force an interger

### to force a string into a interger
"int(variablename)"
